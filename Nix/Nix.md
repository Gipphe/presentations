# Nix

> The most ~~insane~~ powerful package manager you've ~~never~~ maybe heard of.

## What

> Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes
> package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and
> rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package,
> multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

## Why

> ## ðŸš€ Setup
>
> 1. Install [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> 2. Install the package manager PNPM: `npm i -g pnpm@8.10`
> 3. Install dependencies in all apps and libs: `pnpm install`
>    - This will also run the `postinstall` script, which compiles all
>      translations from `.po` files to `.ts` files.
