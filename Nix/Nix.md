# Developer environment as code

> "Just the tip" of Nix

## What

> Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes
> package management reliable and reproducible. It provides **atomic upgrades** and
> rollbacks, side-by-side installation of **multiple versions of a package**,
> multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

## Language agnostic

## Largest package repository

80 000+ packages

## Nix is many things

- Build system
- Configuration tool
- Package manager
- Developer environment manager
- etc.

## Manual setup steps

> ## ðŸš€ Setup
>
> 1. Install [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> 2. Install the package manager PNPM: `npm i -g pnpm@8.10`
> 3. Install dependencies in all apps and libs: `pnpm install`
>    - This will also run the `postinstall` script, which compiles all
>      translations from `.po` files to `.ts` files.
