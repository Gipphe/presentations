### Manual setup steps

> ## ðŸš€ Setup
>
> 1. Install [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en/)
> 2. Install the package manager PNPM: `npm i -g pnpm@8.10`
> 3. Install dependencies in all apps and libs: `pnpm install`
>    - This will also run the `postinstall` script, which compiles all
>      translations from `.po` files to `.ts` files.

## That was a lot...

## Nix

> A package manager

---

### What

> Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes
> package management reliable and reproducible. It provides **atomic upgrades**
> and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of **multiple versions of a
> package**, multi-user package management and easy setup of build
> environments.
>
> &mdash; Copilot

---

### What

> Nix tool. Make software handle easy. No break old, when new come. Fix, build,
> share, all in cave-safe way.
>
> &mdash; ChatGPT, when prompted with "Describe Nix in 4 short sentences like a
> caveman."

### Language agnostic

### Largest package repository

80 000+ packages

## Nix is many things

- Build system
- Configuration tool
- Package manager
- Dev env manager
- etc.

## Nix is many things

- ~~Build system~~
- ~~Configuration tool~~
- ~~Package manager~~
- Dev env manager
- ~~etc.~~

## Demo

---

## IDE support

---

### Visual Studio Code

- [Nix extension pack]
- [Direnv VSCode plugin]

---

### Vim/Neovim

- You're already in the terminal.
- Regular `direnv` and `nix` will do.
- `vim .` or `nvim .`

---

### IntelliJ IDEA

- ~~[Nix plugin]~~
  - Syntax highlighting only
- ~~[direnv plugin]~~
  - Can only load env vars
- ~~[Better direnv plugin]~~
  - Doesn't work

---

### IntelliJ IDEA

- Have to run it from command line
  - `JAVA_HOME`
  - `SCALA_HOME`
  - `idea .`
    - Only required when setting new version
    - Automatic detection
  - Update to Scala or Java a bit manual
    - Remove existing SDK
    - Update
    - Restart IDEA
    - IDEA finds new Java/Scala based on `JAVA_HOME`/`SCALA_HOME`

---

## Conclusion

- Simplifies dependency and SDK handling
- Ensures consistency between developers
- Opt-in
  - Without `direnv` and `nix`, `flake.nix` does nothing
- ~~IDEA is weird~~
